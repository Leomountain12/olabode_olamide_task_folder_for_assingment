#**Task3: Online Store Cart Calculation**

# Create a list of items (e.g., "Book", "Pen", "Bag") and another list of prices (e.g., 500, 100, 2000).

# Start with an empty cart total (cart_total = 0).

# Use assignment operators (+=) to add the price of some items into cart_total.

# Print the list of items and the total price using an f-string like this:


list  = ("book" ,"pen" ,"bag ", "rice" , "shoe")
prices = (500, 100, 2000, 5000, 10000)
cart_total = 0
cart_total += prices[1]
cart_total += prices[3]
cart_total += prices[4]
print(f"list: {cart_total}\ntotal prices: {prices}")
